# Crop-Recommendation-System
A Machine Learning project created using python. Here I have created a Machine Learning  model that helps in <br>recommending a specific crop
for a given soil given various parametres such as the Nitrogen and Potassium content of soil, Humidity of the soil, pH level of soil, annual rainfall and other climatic conditons.<br>
through this project I trained and tested various ML models for maximizing the accuracy of the predictions made by the model.<br>To achieve this I employed different
pre-processing methods and techniques so that the data may be in the most effective form for training of ML models.<br><br>
Throughout the project I made use of 3 diiferent Machine Learning algorithms to create different models and tested out their accuracy.<br>
The three Algorithms used by me in this project are:-<br>
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree Algorithm</li>
  <li>Random Forest Algorithm</li>
  <li>K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm</li>
</ul>
<br>
I have also included the 3 Models trained using the above mentioned algorithms.<br>
<b>NOTE - </b> All the models have been trained using the CropRecommendation Dataset made available on kaggle by username <b>AVDHOOT</b><br>
